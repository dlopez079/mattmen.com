# Project Title

Mattmen, Inc. is a full CRUD website that I am creating using Laravel 8, Jetstream, Livewire, and MySQL.  The environment is built on docker containers which will be managed by Laravel Sail.  I currently have a Windows environment therefore, I have WSL2.0 to help deliver the Ubuntu platform that allows me to work Linux which a developers perferred operating system. Finally, to deploy I use a serverless environment with Laravel Vapor and AWS.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before working with Laravel, your Visual Studio Code (Not Visual Studio 2022) application must have `Remote - WSL` extension installed. Once you are connected with Visual Studio Code and the Remote - WSL, connect to the Linux Distribution by clicking on `WSL` on bottome left of the `Visual Studio Code`.

Figure out where you would like to save your project and run the following installation command.

```
curl -s https://laravel.build/example-app | bash
```


### Installing

Once you run the above code, Laravel will create a scaffolding like no other.  You will have a well organized project.  Some may be indimidated but some may welcome what you see. 

```
cd example-app

./vendor/bin/sail up
```

Navigate to:

```
 http://localhost
```
And just like that you have a site up. 


Laravel has the power to bring you management capabilities withing one framework which primarily uses blade.

## Acknowledgments

* I gotta acknowledge the Laravel team and their endless amount of solutions for developers.  They made this journey so much fun for me.  I started this venture so frustrated and now I couldn't be more happier.  I can't wait to develop some more public projects.
